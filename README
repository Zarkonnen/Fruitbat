Fruitbat is a personal document storage system, storing multi-page documents along with text key/value data.

This is an experimental piece of code. Feel free to comment at david.stark@metalbeetle.com . It uses Apache's Lucene, commons-io, pdfbox, fontbox, jempbox and commons-logging (the latter three as dependencies of commons-io), which are licensed under the Apache 2.0 licence. It also uses Amazon S3 as a storage backend option.

For GUI display on OS X, it uses the Quaqua Look & Feel, licensed under the LGPL.

It also expects an install of ocropus on the system to do OCR with, which you can get from http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/ .

Specifically, you need the "ocropus-0.4.tar.gz" download from http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/downloads/list , as ocropus has now changed the way it works and won't interface properly.

Jars of the required libraries are provided in the lib folder.

THIS CODE IS NOT OPEN SOURCE ITSELF. IT MAY BE RELEASED UNDER AN OSS LICENCE IN THE FUTURE, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL COPYRIGHT DAVID STARK.
